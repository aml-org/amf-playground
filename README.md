# API Modeling Framework - Playground

This repository contains the code for the API Modeling Framework (AMF) Playground hosted under [this URL](https://mulesoft-labs.github.io/amf-playground/app/). 

The playground provides a preview to play with the [API Modeling Framework](https://raml-org.github.io/api-modeling-framework/) and its capabilities like interoperability, introspection, and more.

## Dependencies

The repository already contains all necessary dependencies. It uses the web version of the AMF libraries that you can get from [here](https://github.com/raml-org/api-modeling-framework) by following the instructions for the web build.

## Building

Please make sure that the necessary dependencies are present inside the `public/src` directory. Currently, that should only be a single file.

Execute:

``` bash
$ gulp serve
```
